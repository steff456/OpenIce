Devices
=============

Implementations of interface software for devices in our lab.  

These interfaces are meant to be used (and reused) by other components.  Other components may map the furnished data to other nomenclatures or handle lower level connectivity (to specific network addresses or serial ports) but these interfaces will omit those specifics as much as possible so they can be used in the widest variety of situations.
